The company is organized into departments. Each department has a unique name, a number, and a particular employee who manages the department. We keep track of the start date when that employee began managing the department. A department may have several locations. A department controls a number of project, each of project has a unique name, a number, and a single location. An employee is assigned to one department but may work on several projects, which are not necessarily controlled by the same department.A Employee has a name, address, salary, sex, and dob. We keep track of the number of hours per week that an employee works on each project. We also keep track of the direct supervisor of each employee.
